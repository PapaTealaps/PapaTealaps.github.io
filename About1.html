			Defense of the Ancient (Dota) is a type of Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)<br>The objective of the game is for each team to destroy their opponents' Ancient, a heavily guarded structure at the opposing corner of the map.<br>Defense of the Ancients pits two teams of players against each other: the Sentinel and the Scourge. Players on the Sentinel team are based at the southwest corner of the map, and those on the Scourge team are based at the northeast corner. Each base is defended by towers and waves of units which guard the main paths leading to their base. In the center of each base is the "Ancient", a building that must be destroyed to win the game.<br></p></th>
